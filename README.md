This is the API for the 8-Ball Radio website. It consists of a bot that checks for new shows from the Mixcloud API and updates a MongoDB database accordingly and an Express server that hosts the MongoDB data.

This is halfway complete.

Left to do:
- Bot fixes to check every 10 minutes and update accordingly.
